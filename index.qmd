## Welcome Notes 


It is our pleasure to host the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) Meeting from September 1^st^-7^th^, 2024, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are excited to return to an in-person format for this significant event, bringing together the global community dedicated to immunization and public health.

The EPI Meeting is renowned for uniting immunization experts and public health professionals from various sectors, fostering an environment that encourages dialogue, the exchange of ideas, and cutting-edge scientific research. The theme of this year's meeting is “Immunization and complexity: challenges and responses,” which will cover the full spectrum of contemporary methods and practices in immunization. The meeting will feature esteemed speakers presenting plenary lectures, workshops, and interactive sessions. The programme, driven by submitted abstracts, will include oral and poster presentations showcasing both theoretical and practical aspects from every sub-discipline of immunization. This meeting promises to be an unparalleled opportunity to share experiences and expertise, providing phenomenal opportunities for learning, growth, and networking within the field.

This is the first time the EPI Meeting will be hosted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kinshasa offers a vibrant and dynamic setting for our gathering. Kinshasa is a city of rich cultural heritage and diversity, providing a unique backdrop for our meeting.

We encourage you to take a few days before or after the meeting to explore the beauty and culture of Kinshasa and its surroundings. Additionally, consider visiting other remarkable destinations within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region to complement your trip to Kinshasa.

We invite you to start preparing now for what promises to be a special blend of cutting-edge science in a truly unique setting. We look forward to seeing you in Kinshasa in September 2024!

The Director
